# Task 5 - Decision Trees & Random Forests (AI & ML Internship)

## Objective
Learn tree-based models like Decision Trees and Random Forests for classification using Scikit-learn.

## Dataset
Heart Disease Dataset from Kaggle.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Key Learnings
- Trained and visualized a Decision Tree.
- Controlled tree depth to avoid overfitting.
- Trained and evaluated a Random Forest.
- Interpreted feature importance.
- Used cross-validation for model evaluation.

## Results
- Decision Tree Accuracy: ~X%
- Random Forest Accuracy: ~Y%
- Most important feature: Z
